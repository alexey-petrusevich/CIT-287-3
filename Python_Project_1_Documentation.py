# Description:
#
#   The goal of the project is to introduce students to Python programming
# language - another popular object-oriented programming language. The
# language contains many powerful features that other languages do not
# have. Some of the examples are unique data types (disctionaries, tuples, etc.),
# simplified randomization, no variable type declaration, complex numbers, etc.
#   Although the project could have been written in C++, C# or Java quicker
# due to extensive knowledge of these programming languages, the primary
# goal was to use Python language rather than solving the problem given
# by project guidlines.
#
# Analysis and testing:
#
#   Having no deep knowledge of Python programming language, no classes
# or functions could be implemented in the project. Thus, the program was
# written as a one stand alone program.
#   First step was loading and saving data from the file. Having very simple
# way of handling input/output operations in Python helped to solve that 
# problem in no time.
#   After entering the name of the user, and checking if that name was read
# from the file, the program loads the main menu with 5 choices. The menu 
# was implemented using simple if-elif structure to filter unwanted input
# from the user.
#   Options 1 through 5 were implemented according to specifications of the
# project. While user entries were handled mostly using 'while' loops, 
# iterative operations were handled using 'for' loop.
#   Based on the set of testing runs, all components of the program and
# the program in general proved to be working as requested by project
# specifications.
